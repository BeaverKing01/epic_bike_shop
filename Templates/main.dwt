               <h2>Welcome</h2>
                 <p>At The Epic Bike Shop, we are passionate about bicycles, that's what you'd expect from a bike shop!  Right?  But we take it a step further, we believe in the bicycles ability to take you on a journey to discover yourself in new places and meet new people.  Riding a bicycle is more than racing, it's about sharing the experience and your war stories!  That's what fuels us.</p>
   

            <p>The Epic Bike Shop is located in Plumstead and was established in 2004, we started our small shop to offer service to cyclists out there that grew tired of the mainstream bike shops.  We pride ourselves on service and expertise.  Lance has been building wheels since he was in Primary school and has dedicated his time to learning this black art. Lance also does amazing Carbon Fibre repair work. If it's broken, he can fix it.  There's even talk of his own bike soon.  We are able to service all suspension forks in-house, which is unique as the shops around town find it more convenient to out-source this work to the wholesalers.  We have been building custom bikes from day one, and we mean custom.  From custom fork spray jobs with decals to integrate nicely with the bikes frame scheme.  We even went as far as getting custom pivot bolts done on certain suspension bikes to discern them from the "off the shelf" ones.  We offer bike fitment and suspension tuning, as well as a large variety of accessories and parts for you and your bikes. So gift shopping for your birthday is made convenient and easy. Lance is also an author of a "How to" segment in Bicycling Magazine, and is also part of a Test group for product testing.  Gear testers from other magazines also land up here, having a tech run down of the latest kit with Lance and value his advice. </p>
